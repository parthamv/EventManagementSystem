# Event Management System Application

This repository contains the code for an Event Management System application developed using Java Spring Boot and JavaScript.

## Overview
The Event Management System is a web-based application that allows users to manage and organize various events. It provides functionality for creating events, managing event details, and handling registrations. The application is built using the Java Spring Boot framework on the backend and JavaScript on the frontend.

## Features
1. User Registration and Authentication:
   - Users can register and create an account.
   - Authentication is implemented to ensure secure access to the system.

2. Event Creation and Management:
   - Users with appropriate permissions can create new events by providing details such as title, date, time, location, description, etc.
   - Event organizers can edit and update event details.
   - Events can be categorized into different types or categories.

3. Event Registration:
   - Users can register for events they are interested in attending.
   - The system keeps track of event registrations and participant information.

4. Event Search and Filtering:
   - Users can search for events based on different criteria like title, date, location, and category.
   - The application provides filters to narrow down the search results.

5. User Roles and Permissions:
   - Different user roles are implemented, such as event organizers, participants, and administrators, each with specific permissions.
   - Event organizers have the authority to manage and update their own events.
   - Administrators have access to all events and can perform administrative tasks.

6. Notifications:
   - The system can send notifications to users regarding event updates, reminders, and other relevant information.

## Technologies Used
- Java Spring Boot: Backend framework for building the application's server-side logic and RESTful APIs.
- JavaScript: Frontend scripting language for creating interactive user interfaces.
- HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the application's web pages.
- MySQL/PostgreSQL: Relational database management system to store application data.
- Spring Security: Provides authentication and authorization features.
- Thymeleaf (or any other templating engine): Used for server-side rendering of dynamic web pages.

   - Frontend: Set up a JavaScript package manager (e.g., npm or Yarn) and install frontend dependencies.
4. Set up the database:
   - Create a MySQL or PostgreSQL database instance.
   - Configure the database connection in the application's configuration files.
   - Run database migrations to set up the required tables.
5. Build and run the application:
